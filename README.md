Google Contacts Sync Tool

This tool is intended to run as a service, and mantain in sync a contact group among a few google accounts.
My goal is to mantain a group called "Family" in sync with my wife and children.
Then if I add a new entry (or them), just by tagging the contact with this label, it will be sent to all others.

There are some paid services for this, but I decided to create my own.
